# Computer Science: Game Design 22-23 üéÆ

## Culminating Project - Terrain Game - Due Sunday, June 4 9PM ‚è∞

During this semester, we have learned how to apply fundamental coding principles of C# to game design and development using the Unity Game Engine. Now, it's time for the culminating project of the Game Design course. You have the option to either continue working on your game terrain project or create a new game.

## Checklist of Requirements for the Final Game Project ‚úÖ

| Objective                                                                                  | Description                                                                                                    |

| Apply your knowledge of terrains to design and build a game with a story!                  | Create a game with a storyline where players have specific goals and encounter obstacles along the way.        |
| Create a win condition (i.e., find the treasure)                                           | Design a condition that signifies the player's victory, such as finding the treasure or completing a task.     |
| Create obstacles, diversions, or enemies to prevent the player from reaching the objective | Implement elements in the game that challenge the player and require them to strategize and overcome hurdles.  |
| Use sounds, lighting, and assets to create an aesthetic for your story                      | Utilize audio effects, lighting techniques, and suitable visual assets to enhance the overall game experience. |
| Implement a first-person controller for player navigation through the terrain              | Develop a controller that allows players to navigate through the game environment in a first-person perspective. |
| Implement collisions with objects or game elements                                         | Ensure that collisions between the player and objects/elements in the game trigger appropriate actions or events. |
| Prevent the player from falling off the terrain (for terrain games)                         | Implement mechanisms to prevent the player from falling off the terrain, ensuring they stay within bounds.      |
| Use GUI elements for labels, buttons, or boxes for your game                               | Incorporate graphical user interface (GUI) elements to display information, create interactive buttons, etc.    |
| Save game elements using PlayerPrefs or persistence between scenes                          | Utilize PlayerPrefs or persistence mechanisms to save and retain game data between different scenes or sessions. |
| Implement at least two scenes in your game                                                  | Create multiple game scenes to provide different gameplay scenarios, menu screens, or level progression.       |
| Document and comment your code fully                                                       | Add comprehensive comments to your code to explain its functionality, increase readability, and aid future edits. |
| Use proper C# naming conventions                                                           | Follow appropriate naming conventions in your C# code to ensure consistency and clarity throughout the project. |
| Playtest the game with someone other than a family member, friend, or classmate             | Have someone outside your immediate circle playtest the game to gather feedback and identify areas for improvement. |
